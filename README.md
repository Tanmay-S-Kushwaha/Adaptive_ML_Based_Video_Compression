# Adaptive_ML_Based_Video_Compression
Modern video compression uses static compression parameters that fail to adapt to scene complexity. This project introduces an intelligent, machine learning-driven approach to optimize compression parameters per segment, maintaining consistent perceptual quality while minimizing wasted bitrate.
